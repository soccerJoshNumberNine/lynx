About Lynx



Origin:

Lynx was, at first, envisioned to be a chat bot that would perform similarly to artificial intelligence. As I began to make it, it was quickly obvious that even a basic AI was beyond my capabilities.
I decided to tone it down to just be an assistant that would tell me information based on my input. Inspired by the hackery looking terminals seen in sci-fi movies, I made the black/green GUI as my first step.

Now:

Lynx is a basic terminal that tells me the events for the day, what jersey I have to wear to practice, and the time/day etc. The sign-in system is fun, but not secure, and the whole system is really only useful for me.

For the Future:

I hope to make Lynx a reminder bot that can help everyone. Using an SQL server, I hope to allow users to generate their own events that Lynx will remind them of.
