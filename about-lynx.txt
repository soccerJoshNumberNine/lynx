About Lynx

Origin:

Lynx was, at first, envisioned to be a chat bot that would perform similarly to artificial intelligence. 
As I began to make it, it was quickly obvious that even a basic AI was beyond my capabilities.
I decided to tone it down to just be an assistant that would tell me information based on my input. 
Inspired by the hackery looking terminals seen in sci-fi movies, I made the black/green GUI as my first step.

Now:

Lynx displays a list of events, times, and notes for the day. 
For now, Lynx is only useful to me, but it wouldn't be tremendously difficult for one to fork the project and make it usable for them.

For the Future:

I hope to make Lynx a reminder bot that can help everyone.
Using an SQL server, I hope to allow users to generate their own events that Lynx will remind them of.
